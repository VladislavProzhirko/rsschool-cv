                        <p><span>Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and</span> <span>statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The</span> <span>others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky</span> chance to become dearly loved.</p>
                        <p><span>We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they</span> <span>do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and</span> <span>well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of</span> <span>various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the</span> <span>shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached</span> to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
